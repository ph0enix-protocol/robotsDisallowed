# robotsDisallowed ðŸ¤–

A lightweight security reconnaissance tool that extracts and analyzes disallowed paths from robots.txt files, helping security researchers and penetration testers discover potentially sensitive endpoints.

# Overview

robotsDisallowed automatically scans and extracts paths from robots.txt files, creating a comprehensive wordlist of potentially hidden or sensitive directories and files. While robots.txt files are intended to guide search engine crawlers, they often inadvertently reveal valuable information about a website's structure and sensitive areas that organizations want to keep hidden from search engines.

The tool leverages data from CommonCrawl and top million websites rankings to perform large-scale analysis of robots.txt files across the internet. This broad scanning capability allows for:

1. Creation of comprehensive wordlists based on real-world data
2. Identification of common patterns in restricted paths across different industries
3. Discovery of industry-specific sensitive endpoints and naming conventions

# Why Use robotsDisallowed?

### For Security Researchers

- Quick Reconnaissance: Rapidly identify potential sensitive endpoints without manual inspection
- Automated Wordlist Generation: Create custom wordlists for further security testing and directory bruteforcing
- Pattern Recognition: Identify common patterns in restricted paths that might indicate vulnerable areas
- Time Efficiency: Automate the initial phase of security assessment by quickly gathering potential target endpoints

### For Organizations

- Security Auditing: Verify that sensitive paths are properly protected, not just hidden from search engines
- Exposure Assessment: Understand what sensitive information might be exposed through robots.txt
- Configuration Review: Identify potentially misconfigured access controls
- Compliance Checking: Ensure sensitive paths are properly documented and protected according to security policies
